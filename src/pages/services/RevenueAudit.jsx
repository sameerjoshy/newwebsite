      <h1>Revenue Audit & Leakage Prevention</h1>
      <p>
        Even the best GTM machines leak revenue — through missed handoffs, outdated data, or poor process design. Our audit helps you spot and plug these leaks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audit of your end-to-end GTM funnel — from lead to renewal</li>
        <li>Review of CRM hygiene, pipeline stages, and handoff processes</li>
        <li>Analysis of conversion drop-offs, win-loss data, and activity gaps</li>
        <li>Recommendations and prioritized playbook to fix leaks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Perfect for founders, RevOps, or GTM leaders who suspect there's money being left on the table.
